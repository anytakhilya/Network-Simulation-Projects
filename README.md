## About this repository

This repository contains my network simulation projects completed in **Cisco Packet Tracer** as part of the IT training course in *Microcomputer Systems and Networks* (Spain, 2024–2025).

The goal is to demonstrate practical skills in designing, configuring, analyzing, and troubleshooting various types of networks and services, using different topologies (star, bus, ring, tree), IP addressing, and routing methods.

The project is oriented toward an online internship or entry-level positions in networking technologies.

## Projects included

### Basic Labs:
- Simple LAN network with DHCP server
- Static Routing — basic routing between subnets
- VLAN configuration — traffic isolation using VLANs
- Routing between VLANs (Inter-VLAN routing)
- EIGRP configuration
- IPv6 basic configuration
- Multi-router network (star topology)

### Advanced Labs:
- Tree topology switching lab
- Hybrid networks (star, bus, ring, tree)
- Internet Cloud with modems and routers
- Network with Cloud & Modem simulation — Internet access via cloud/modem
- Firewall and ACL lab
- WAN topology simulation
- Advanced VLAN routing (multi-VLAN and multi-router lab)
- Advanced subnetting and addressing scenarios

### Examples from screenshots:
- Multi-router network with static and dynamic routing
- Hybrid topology with Internet access simulation
- Star topology for VLAN and DHCP segments
- Combined bus and ring networks for local access
- Complex network with VLANs + ACL + IPv6
- Internet Cloud → Modem → Router → Switches → Clients
- Campus-style network with multiple subnets
